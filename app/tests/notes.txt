Unit testing using PHPunit
===================================================================

Important things to note when creating tests:
===================================================================

    * The class must inherit from 'PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase'
    
    * Each test must be prefixed with 'test'
    
    * There are issues with using $GLOBALS and PDO objects
      - these can be easily fixed using the following at the
        top of the test
        
        /**
        * @backupGlobals disabled
        * @backupStaticAttributes disabled
        */


How to Run Tests from CMD
===================================================================

    * Open up a new command prompt window
    
    * Navigate to a suitable folder
    
    * Type 'phpunit tests.php'
